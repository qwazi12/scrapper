# Scrapper Memory

Persistent log of everything this scraper has downloaded. Appended
automatically on every run of `scrape.py`, committed to git so history
survives across machines.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/qwazi12/scrapper
- **Engine:** [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (handles X/Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, IG, ~1800 sites)
- **Videos live in:** `downloads/` (local only, gitignored)
- **Dedup ledger:** `archive.txt` — delete a line to allow re-download
- **Full logs:** `logs/scraper.log` (every yt-dlp line) and `logs/manifest.jsonl` (one JSON record per video)
- **Web app — LIVE:** [`BUILD_PLAN.md`](BUILD_PLAN.md) — storyboard web app deployed. **App: https://scrapper.nodepilot.dev** (Vercel frontend) ↔ backend https://scrapper-production-d348.up.railway.app (Railway, FastAPI + volume). Enter the access token (in `data/access_token.txt`, gitignored) once via the ⚙ Connection panel. Verified end-to-end in production: X scrape → compile → download.
- **Reliability:** all 5 anti-blocking layers implemented — nightly yt-dlp self-update, burner cookies upload, retries+backoff, proxy support, standalone hybrid worker — plus observability (per-source success tracking + alert webhook). See BUILD_PLAN §10.
- **Bulk actions:** Storyboard has a select-all checkbox + "🗑 Delete N" (deletes checked clips + their files); Export has per-row checkboxes, select-all, and "🗑 Delete N".
- **Anti-ban pacing (platform-aware):** `-t sleep` is ON by default (`YTDLP_SLEEP_PRESET`) for X/TikTok — 0.75s between requests + randomized 10–20s between downloads, ~40s/clip. **YouTube must NOT get the 10–20s pre-download sleep**: its media URLs return `HTTP 403` when fetched that long after extraction (verified by isolating the flags). YouTube gets `--sleep-requests 0.75` only. See `pacing_args()` in `backend/core/scraper.py`.
- **YouTube on Railway is blocked by IP, not by login.** The datacenter IP gets "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"; the same URL succeeds from a residential IP with no cookies at all. Cookies do NOT fix an IP block, and pushing account cookies through a datacenter IP is what gets Google accounts flagged — so route around it with the local worker instead.
- **Local worker (the YouTube fix):** `scripts/local_worker.py` polls `GET /api/clips/blocked`, downloads on the home connection, and uploads via `POST /api/clips/{id}/upload`. `scripts/install_local_worker.sh` runs it under launchd. Blocked URLs fail fast (no retries) and wait in that queue. **2026-09-29, three bugs that meant nothing ever arrived:** (1) rescan (every startup + ↻ button) pruned failed rows with no file — the whole blocked queue; `rescan_library()` now skips them. (2) The worker sent the full yt-dlp info.json as the `meta` form field; YouTube's is >1 MB and Starlette 400s any field over 1 MB, so it now sends only the fields the server reads. (3) launchd ran it with `--browser safari`, which needs Full Disk Access and failed every time with EPERM — dropped; no cookies are needed from the home IP. Verified end-to-end: a 283 MB YouTube video downloaded at home and uploaded to Railway. PO tokens don't help (the block is by IP). The launchd wrapper is `~/scrapper-worker/run.sh` (python `-u` so `~/scrapper-worker/worker.log` isn't empty). (4) launchd's PATH is only `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, so the worker failed with `No such file or directory: 'yt-dlp'` (and couldn't find node/ffmpeg either) — `run.sh` now exports a full PATH. Manual runs hid this because they inherit the shell's PATH: **test the worker through launchd, not by hand.** Verified under launchd 2026-09-29 (clip #2). `run.sh` lives outside the repo and isn't version-controlled.
- **UI & local worker resilience (2026-09-29):** (1) Fixed confusing failure messaging: when Railway is bot-blocked by YouTube, instead of `[scrape_fail] 0 ok, 1 failed`, it logs `[queued_for_local_worker] Railway blocked by YouTube — transferred to your Mac worker for residential download.` and `[ingest_done] job X: 1 queued for Mac worker`. (2) Frontend clip table shows `● queued for mac` in yellow instead of `● failed`. (3) `scripts/local_worker.py` now logs timestamps, emits periodic heartbeat (`checked queue: 0 blocked URLs`) so logs aren't mysteriously silent, and retries uploads 3x with backoff to survive Railway restarts without re-downloading. Verified end-to-end with 606 MB video #3 (`EavKQdjU4p8`).
- **Future-proofing upgrades (P1–P3, 2026-09-29):**
  - **P1 (Optimal 1080p Format Sorting):** Added `--format-sort "res:1080"` to both `backend/core/scraper.py` and `scripts/local_worker.py`. Caps video height/width to 1080p, preventing bloated 4K/8K downloads, cutting file transfer sizes by ~75% while perfectly matching Scrapper's 1080p compilation canvas (both portrait 1080x1920 and landscape 1920x1080).
  - **P2 (Fast 15-second Polling):** Dropped worker queue polling interval from 120s to 15s in `scripts/local_worker.py` and `~/scrapper-worker/run.sh`. Queued clips are now picked up within ~15s instead of 2 minutes. Empty queue log is throttled to 2m heartbeats to keep logs clean.
  - **P3 (CI/CD & Deployment Synchronization):** Added `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` and `scripts/deploy_frontend.sh` to ensure Vercel frontend and Railway backend stay in sync on every push to `main`.
- **Social Media Publishing via Outstand (2026-09-30):**
  - **Decoupled from Google Cloud:** Eliminated Cloud Run, Google Drive, and Google Sheets completely. Scrapper runs entirely on Railway (backend + volume storage) + Vercel (frontend) + Outstand (unified social publishing).
  - **Provider Migration (Blotato -> Outstand):** Switched to Outstand API (`https://api.outstand.so/v1`) using `OUTSTAND_API_KEY` stored securely in Railway env vars.
  - **3-step Presigned Video Upload:** In `backend/app/social/outstand.py`, compilation videos are uploaded directly from Railway disk to Outstand (`/v1/media/upload` -> `PUT upload_url` -> `/v1/media/{id}/confirm`).
  - **Multi-Platform Support:** Supports posting and scheduling to TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, X, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, and Bluesky via `POST /v1/posts/`.
  - **AI Metadata Generator:** In `backend/app/social/metadata.py`, uses Gemini REST API to generate viral titles, hooks, captions, and hashtags from compilation clip titles, with a deterministic template fallback if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is omitted.
  - **Interactive Publishing UI:** Added `PublishModal.tsx` in frontend with dynamic connected accounts list, 1-click AI caption generation, datetime scheduling picker (up to 30 days), and real-time status feedback.
- **Posting Queue & Content Calendar (Replacing Google Sheets, 2026-09-30):**
  - **Full Google Sheets Schema Brought In:** Replaced the fragile Google Sheets queue from `socialpilot_Ai` with a database-backed `QueueItem` model matching all 9 columns: `ID | Video Name | Drive Link | Title | Description | Tags | Status | Notes | Source`.
  - **Status Lifecycle:** `Review` (new video, needs review/approval) -> `Ready to post` (approved & scheduled) -> `Posting` (active Outstand upload) -> `Posted` / `Retry` / `Error` -> `Archived`.
  - **Ops Dashboard (`QueuePanel.tsx`):** Added a dedicated command-center table with filter pills (Needs Review, Ready to Post, Scheduled, Posted Archive, Errors), pipeline dropdown (Movie Clips, Abyss Declassified, The ICK Room, Default), bulk actions (Approve, Delete, Archive), and inline row edit modals.
  - **1-Click Queue Additions:** Added `+ Queue` buttons to both Storyboard clips and Export compilations.
  - **Background Scheduler Daemon:** In `backend/app/social/queue_manager.py`, a background thread polls every 30s for due `ready` items and executes Outstand publishing automatically without human intervention.
  - **SocialPilot AI Retention Exemption:** Videos and records in the SocialPilot posting queue and compilations are **strictly exempt from the 5-day retention sweep** (`backend/app/cleanup.py`) — until posted: see the 4-day archive cleanup (2026-09-30 audit below).
  - **Multi-Channel Google Drive Ingestion & Organization (2026-09-30):**
    - Connected Google Drive parent folder `1kuOKRQQRL0ws5aOVqwkdUzdnfj5KQGjo` (`Movie Clips`) using service account `omnistream-bot@manhwa-engine.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (configured on Railway as `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`).
    - Multi-channel engine in `backend/app/drive_sync.py` and `scripts/sync_drive.py` scans subfolders as distinct channel handles (`@VynixAE`, `@PixelDrift-f3c`, `@SolarrEditss`, `@AlphaReels-1`, `@EditAetheris`, `@CoruscateCuts`, `@FrameLegion`, `@roebutt`, `@TheUsJournal17`, `@SceneVale`, `@QianaLucy`, `@clipscav`, `@hanganhoang3071`, `@comet-cinema`).
    - Synced 700 rows — **but Drive actually holds 690**: 10 `@SolarrEditss` videos were imported twice (deleted 2026-09-30; a unique index on `drive_link` now blocks repeats). Originally synced 700 ready-to-post short videos into Railway PostgreSQL with direct Google Drive view links, extracted hashtags, and cleaned titles.
    - Updated folder tracking so parent folder `Movie Clips` includes all 700 items across all 14 channels, while each row displays its exact folder breadcrumb (e.g. `Movie Clips / @PixelDrift-f3c`).
  - **Mix & Shuffle Suite (`/api/queue/shuffle`):**
    - `Round-Robin Mix`: Interleaves items across all 14 channels so consecutive posts alternate creators and maintain channel diversity (matching `mix_videos_roundrobin.js` from `socialpilot_Ai`).
    - `Full Random Shuffle`: Global Fisher-Yates random ordering.
    - `By-Channel Shuffle`: Shuffles within each channel bucket.
  - **Mass Select & Status Change (`/api/queue/bulk-action`):**
    - Select all or visible items, mass change status to `Ready to Post`, `Needs Review`, `Posted`, or `Archived`.
    - Mass assign target Outstand social accounts (e.g. YouTube, TikTok, IG, FB).
  - **Social Media Platform Wiring via Outstand:**
    - Table includes `Target Social Accounts` column displaying platform badges (e.g. `▶️ @flamingoremix` (YouTube)).
    - Automatic on-demand streaming from Google Drive for posting: when a video from Drive is published, `queue_manager.py` downloads it temporarily, uploads to Outstand, and immediately cleans up the local file, keeping disk usage zero.
  - **Bulk Channel Scraper & Ingest (`ChannelIngestPanel.tsx` & `/api/social/ingest-channel`):**
    - Dedicated tab inside SocialPilot AI to paste a channel shorts URL (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/@Channel/shorts`).
    - Automatically discovers or creates the channel subfolder under `Movie Clips` in Google Drive, uploads the 1080p MP4 directly, deletes local temp files, and adds to queue.
  - **Error & Retry Inspector:**
    - Filter tab `⚠️ Errors / Retry` shows error logs and failure reasons with a one-click `↻ Retry All Failed` button.
- **Repo location:** `~/dev/scrapper` (mapped to `qwazi12/scrapper`). NOT `~/Desktop/scrapper`: that iCloud copy hangs and its `.git` was wiped on 2026-09-30.
- **Gotchas that cost real debugging time:** yt-dlp writes typographic quotes (`you’re`, U+2019) so error matching must fold curly quotes; FastAPI needs `Form(...)` on multipart text fields or it reads them as query params and silently drops them; macOS python.org builds have no CA store, so scripts need a certifi SSL context.
- **Cookies:** `--cookies-from-browser` (`COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER`) only works where a browser profile exists (your Mac / hybrid worker), never on Railway. For the cloud use `scripts/sync_cookies.py` (+ `install_cookie_sync.sh` for a daily launchd job) to push browser cookies to `/api/cookies`. Use a BURNER account — a cookie jar is a live credential.
- **Retention:** `RETENTION_DAYS=5` — per-item rolling TTL from each row's `created_at` (scraped Thursday → expires Tuesday), swept every 30m by the worker, skipping queued/running items. `0` disables. UI shows an "expires" countdown. SocialPilot queue items are preserved until posted; posted/archived items are removed `ARCHIVE_DELETE_DAYS` (4) after posting, Drive file moved to trash.
- **Self-healing:** a "↻ Rescan library" button + startup reconcile rebuilds the DB from video files on the volume and keeps the DB / files / `archive.txt` in sync. Deleting a clip now also clears its id from `archive.txt` so it can be re-scraped (no more phantom "skipped"). Auth also accepts `?token=` for download/thumbnail/SSE (browser GETs can't send headers).

## How to use

```bash
# add links to urls.txt, then:
python3 scrape.py

# or download one-off links directly:
python3 scrape.py https://x.com/user/status/123...
```

## Architecture Update — 2026-09-30

### 1. Reactive Studio Sidebar & Dedicated Views
- Replaced the stacked single-page feed with a responsive left navigation sidebar featuring live item badges:
  - 📋 **Posting Queue & Schedule** (`X items`) — Dedicated full-width Google Sheets spreadsheet view.
  - 🎬 **Storyboard & Clips** (`X clips`) — Trimming, aspect ratio selection, video player.
  - 📥 **Ingest & Scraper** — Ingestion queue, Mac worker residential status.
  - 🎞️ **Compilations & Exports** (`X comps`) — Multi-clip stitcher, transitions, audio tracks.
  - ☁️ **Google Drive Sync** — Direct Google Drive folder ingestion and channel mapping.
  - 📜 **Live Activity Logs** — Real-time SSE worker feed.
  - ⚙️ **Settings & Channels** — Outstand connected accounts (Flamingo Remix, etc.) and volume storage health.
  - 🌟 **All-in-One Studio** — Stacked overview.

### 2. Google Sheets Replacement in Scrapper
- 9-column data model (`id`, `video_name`, `drive_link`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, `status`, `notes`, `source`).
- Lifecycle status tracking: `review` ➔ `ready` ➔ `posting` ➔ `posted` / `retry` / `error` ➔ `archived`.
- Automated background publishing daemon running in FastAPI backend every 30s.
- Multi-channel filtering: `Movie Clips`, `Abyss Declassified`, `The ICK Room`, `Default`.

### 3. Google Drive Ingestion
- UI Panel: `frontend/app/DrivePanel.tsx` allows entering Google Drive folder URL/ID and destination channel.
- CLI Tool: `scripts/sync_drive.py` allows Mac worker or automation to scan and queue videos from Google Drive folders directly into Scrapper.

### 4. Landing Page Core Experience & Direct Device Download
- Landing Page (`/`): Pure original Scrapper view. User pastes link(s), clicks Scrape, and the clips table shows the video with a direct **⬇ Download** button to immediately download the MP4 file to their device.
- Direct Clip Download API: `GET /api/clips/{clip_id}/download` added to FastAPI backend, streaming the raw MP4 file directly to the user's browser with the video title as filename.
- Sidebar Navigation: All other secondary workflows (Posting Queue, Compilations, Google Drive Ingestion, Live Logs, Settings) are housed cleanly in the sidebar as separate views.

### 5. SocialPilot Retention Exemption & System Separation
- **Strict Retention Exemption:** In `backend/app/cleanup.py`, any clip or compilation referenced in `QueueItem` (status: `review`, `ready`, `posting`, `posted`, `retry`) is explicitly filtered out and protected from the 30-minute rolling retention sweep (`RETENTION_DAYS=5`). Scheduled content will never be deleted before or during posting.
- **Dedicated Sidebar Tab:** Isolated SocialPilot into its own dedicated **"🚀 SocialPilot AI"** tab containing the Google Sheets posting queue and Google Drive channel ingestion tools.
- **Permanent Cloud Archive:** Videos in SocialPilot reside in Google Drive as the permanent repository; Scrapper reads and distributes them to Outstand without clogging Railway volume disk space.


## Log — 2026-09-30 — SocialPilot audit & fixes

- **Mix & Shuffle did nothing visible:** it computed an order but never stored it (list sorted by `id` desc) and overwrote every row's Notes with "Shuffle sequence #N". Now writes `QueueItem.position` (new column; idempotent migration in `db._migrate()`), keeps Notes, and the list returns posting order.
- **Auto-posting never fired:** the scheduler only posted Ready items that had a `scheduled_at`, and approving never set one. New planner (`queue_manager.plan_schedule`) gives Ready items slots every 2h 8am–10pm America/New_York (from socialpilot_Ai CONFIG.md), one per pipeline per slot, in `position` order. Late slots (>30m) are re-planned, never back-filled. Config: `POST_TIMEZONE/POST_START_HOUR/POST_END_HOUR/POST_INTERVAL_HOURS`, validated at startup.
- **4-day archive cleanup:** posted/archived items are deleted `ARCHIVE_DELETE_DAYS` (default 4) after `published_at`; the Drive file is moved to trash first (recoverable 30 days). If trashing fails the row is kept and retried. Bulk "posted"/"archived" now stamps `published_at`.
- **AI button:** called `gemini-2.0-flash` (retired) and silently fell back to a canned template. Model is now `GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`); the ✨ AI endpoint returns the real error instead of template text.
- **Post Now "File not found in storage":** upload flow matches Outstand docs; suspected cause is non-ASCII/`#` filenames breaking the presigned key. Upload names are now ASCII-sanitized (`outstand.safe_upload_name`) and failures report media id/size/PUT status. **Unverified** — needs a Post Now retry in prod.
- **UI:** pipeline dropdowns show top-level pipelines only; sort by posting order/ID/title/channel/status/time with ↑/↓; rows show next slot (ET) and delete date; Mass Edit (title/description/tags/pipeline); Settings shows schedule, Outstand accounts, AI and cleanup status (`SettingsOverview.tsx`, `GET /api/schedule`).
- **Tests:** `backend/tests/` (pytest, mock creds): `backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests`.

## Log — 2026-09-30 — Outstand posting is async; YouTube quota

- Upload fix (ASCII filenames) **verified**: Outstand accepted the media and created the post.
- **Disconnect bug:** we set "posted" as soon as Outstand accepted the request, but Outstand publishes asynchronously and reports per-account `pending/published/failed` on `GET /v1/posts/{id}`. Items now stay `posting` until `queue_manager.reconcile_posting()` (every scheduler tick) sees final results: all published -> `posted` + `published_at` (4-day clock starts); any failed -> `retry` with `accounts` narrowed to only the failed ones (no double posts) and errors in notes. Before this, a failed post would also have had its Drive file trashed after 4 days.
- **YouTube 429 "Video Uploads per day":** Outstand Managed Keys route all customers' YouTube uploads through Outstand's Google project (42435067551); quota is shared (~6 uploads/day per project: 10k units, 1,600 per upload). Fix is BYOK in Outstand (own GCP project, YouTube Data API v3, redirect `https://www.outstand.so/app/api/socials/youtube/callback`), and a quota increase from Google for >6/day. The 8-slot schedule x YouTube accounts exceeds the default quota.
- Gemini default model -> `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (2.5 is closed to new users per Google's model page, 2026-09).

## Log — 2026-10-01 — Migrated publishing Outstand -> Upload-Post

Followed qwazi12/manhwa `docs/UPLOAD_POST_MIGRATION.md`.
- **Why:** Outstand Managed Keys = one shared Google project (`defaultVideoInsertPerDayPerProject = 100` across all customers); our YouTube posts 429'd.
- **Client:** `backend/app/social/upload_post.py` (only publisher; `outstand.py` deleted, guard tests stop it returning). Key: `UPLOADPOST_API_KEY` (also `UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY` / `UPLOADPOST_KEY`); unset -> accounts endpoint says so and publishing is blocked, no fallback.
- **Account ids are `"<profile>:<network>"`** from `GET /uploadposts/users`. One upload request per profile (`queue_manager.submit_upload`); picked accounts are re-checked against what is connected before anything is sent.
- **Nothing is auto-picked:** queue items without accounts get no slot and Post Now refuses; PublishModal and Assign Accounts open with nothing ticked; confirm dialogs name exactly the picked channels + visibility (`PUBLISH_PRIVACY`, default public).
- **Results:** `publish_requests` (new JSON column on queue_items + social_posts, idempotent migration) holds request_ids; `reconcile_posting()` polls `/uploadposts/status` each tick. All accounts succeeded -> `posted` (+4-day clock); any failed -> `retry` with only the failed accounts; still processing after 3h -> failed.
- Old `outstand_post_id`/`media_url` columns left in the DB as history, no longer in the API.
- **To do (owner):** set `UPLOADPOST_API_KEY` on the Railway scrapper service; delete `OUTSTAND_*` env vars there; revoke the Outstand key in its dashboard. First live publish: one channel, check the row's notes get a post URL.

## Log — 2026-10-01 — Pick targets by Upload-Post profile

- Live Upload-Post setup (read 2026-10-01): profile `default` -> YouTube **Screen Central**; profile `mk` -> YouTube **Flamingo Remix**.
- Targets can now be a whole profile, stored as `"<profile>:*"`: it posts to every channel connected to that profile *at post time* (`upload_post.expand_targets`). Specific channels are still `"<profile>:<network>"`. Retries narrow to the specific failed channels.
- UI: shared `frontend/app/TargetPicker.tsx` (profile cards, with "pick specific channels" inside) is used by the queue's target modal and the compilation Publish window. The queue column "Posts To (Upload-Post)" shows labelled chips (`📁 default · all channels — Screen Central (Youtube)`), "✎ change", or "⚠ None picked — choose".
